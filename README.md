This is a clone of <a href='https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyPOTS'>PyPOTS</a>.

There are five files named 'experiment_*.py' under pypots/tests, where * stands for 05, 10, 15, 20 and 25.
These files can be run directly and the results will be saved under pypots/results folder as pickle files. Each pickle file contains results for Mean, Brits, Saits and Csaits for the feature masked.
Hence, for a given experiment_*.py file, we expect 6 files to be created (one per individual feature masked and one for all features masked).
